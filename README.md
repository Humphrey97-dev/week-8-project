# Clinic Booking System Database

## Description
This project implements a fully relational database management system for a Clinic Booking System using MySQL. The database manages core entities such as Patients, Doctors, Clinic Rooms, and Appointments. It enforces data integrity through proper use of primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and not-null requirements. The system supports scheduling appointments with doctors, prevents double-booking, and allows appointments to be linked with clinic rooms.

## How to Run / Setup
1. Ensure you have MySQL installed and running on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the SQL file `clinic_booking_system.sql`.
3. Open MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or any MySQL client.
4. Run the SQL script to create the database and tables:
   - You can execute the entire SQL file at once.
   - The script creates a database named `clinic_booking` and all related tables with constraints.
5. After running the script, the database is ready for use.
